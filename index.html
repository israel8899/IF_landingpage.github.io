</header>

<section>
    <h2>1. Domestic Labor & Employment</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Phase out foreign labor in sectors where Israelis are available within five years.</li>
        <li>Create 200,000 new domestic jobs through vocational training, apprenticeships, and industrial development.</li>
        <li>Launch a Young Immigrant Workforce Initiative: attract 50,000 young immigrants to join the labor force in the first three years.</li>
        <li>Provide tax incentives for businesses that maintain 80%+ Israeli staff; penalize wage suppression through foreign labor.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>2. Housing & Generational Wealth</h2>
    <p>Young Israelis work hard, pay rent, and still cannot afford to own a home. Meanwhile, the powerful hoard land and build overpriced apartments.</p>

        <li>Build rail networks and highways connecting all regions, including Judea, Samaria, Negev, and Galilee.</li>

        <li>Implement mandatory national defense coordination for critical infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Geopolitical Independence & Democratic Alliances</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Diversify diplomatic and trade relations to reduce reliance on any single foreign power.</li>
        <li>Lead the creation of a Democratic Alliance of Nations: democracies coordinate on security, economic policy, and global diplomacy.</li>
        <li>Exclude authoritarian regimes from influencing this alliance.</li>
        <li>Develop bilateral partnerships with emerging powers for technology transfer and defense collaboration.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Anti-Corruption & Transparency</h2>

        <li>Establish an independent auditing authority to examine all ministries, public bodies, and state-funded entities.</li>
        <li>Mandate public disclosure of foreign donations, contracts, and influence in government decision-making.</li>
        <li>Introduce whistleblower protections for employees reporting corruption or undue foreign influence.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>

    <ul>
        <li>Encourage civic programs that bridge secular, religious, urban, and rural communities.</li>
        <li>Implement youth and veteran engagement programs linking national service to employment and education benefits.</li>
        <li>Promote community integration initiatives to foster mutual respect and shared responsibility.</li>
